### The Rules:
#### Code:
#### C#
* use the traditional C# naming conventions
* make/use a new controller for different entities
* comment all public methods/functions
  * comment sensibly and descriptively
* break lines at 90
* use sensible white space between functions etc.

<br>

#### JavaScript
* use external JavaScript files, kept in the (???) folder

<br>

<br>

#### Database
* don't mess with our db unless it's okay'd
* table names are plural
* primary keys for tables are like `PetID`
  (notice case + format -- NOT JUST `ID`!)
* foreign keys are like (??)

<br>

#### Git
* make/use feature branches
  * put your initials in front, i.e., `tlh_feature_thing`
* commit often!
  * even if a whole feature isn't finished, if part of it is good... commit!
* write sensible descriptive commit messages
* if it doesn't compile... don't commit!
* merge your `feature_branch` into `dev` branch
  * leave `master` the heck alone!
* take care of your own merge conflicts
  * we're not your mom (or dad, as the case may be)
