### The Rules:
### Code:
#### General
* for the love of god use 4-space indents, *not two!*
* please double-space between functions.  
    * (at least one of us appreciates vertical white space for readability)   [=

<br> 

#### C#
* use traditional C# naming conventions
* make/use a new controller for different entities
* comment all public methods/functions
  * comment sensibly and descriptively
* name functions, variables, etc. something that is descriptive and sensible
* break lines at 90
* use sensible white space between functions etc.

<br>

#### JavaScript
* use external JavaScript files, kept in the (???) folder
* comment all public methods/functions
  * comment sensibly and descriptively
* name functions, variables, etc. something that is descriptive and sensible
* break lines at 90
* use sensible white space between functions etc.

<br>

#### Styling
* use external CSS files -- no inline except in testing
* use classes vs. id's appropriately
  * use sensible and descriptive class & id names

* color scheme:

<br>

### Database
* don't mess with our db unless it's okay'd
* table names are plural
* primary keys for tables are like `PetID`
  (notice case + format -- NOT JUST `ID`!)
* foreign keys are like (??)

<br>

### Git
* make/use feature branches
  * put your initials in front, i.e., `tlh_feature_thing`
* commit often!
  * even if a whole feature isn't finished, if part of it is good... commit!
* write sensible descriptive commit messages
* if it doesn't compile... don't commit!
* merge your `feature_branch` into `dev` branch
  * leave `master` the heck alone!
* take care of your own merge conflicts
  * we're not your mom (or dad, as the case may be)
